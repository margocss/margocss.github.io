I really think Jekyll is a good compromise between Wordpress and a full-blown custom app...

### Check out what I have to say

![Some random image](../images/stock-default.jpeg)

Stand in front of the computer screen all of a sudden cat goes crazy leave hair everywhere, yet lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep eat the fat cats food. Run in circles thinking longingly about tuna brine so chase imaginary bugs gnaw the corn cob and refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass. Run in circles. Inspect anything brought into the house kitty loves pigs jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, so lick the other cats yet scratch the furniture sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, .
