      <h4>Goal</h4>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to setup a basic jekyll project scaffold that can be cloned from github that has bootstrap loaded and some sane scss defaults. The idea is to give some structure and code examples for getting a jekyll project off the ground while still promoting and encouraging flexibility in modifying the layout.  
      </p>
